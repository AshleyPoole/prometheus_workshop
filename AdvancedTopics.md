## Advanced topics

Lets now get into more advanced use cases.

### Recording rules

With recording rules, Prometheus creates new time series from existing time
series, improving the response time for queries which are often executed.

*Exercise: Create a recording rule that stores the percentage of CPU idle across all CPUs.*

### Advanced relabeling

Start the blackbox_exporter service:

```
docker run -d --net prometheus --name blackbox_exporter -p 127.0.0.1:9115:9115 \
    -v $PWD/conf/advanced_topics/blackbox.yml:/etc/blackbox_exporter/config.yml \
    prom/blackbox-exporter:v0.11.0
```

Check that the service is working:

```
curl http://localhost:9115/probe?target=https://snowcamp.io
```

Update the Prometheus container to scrape the blackbox_exporter:

```
docker run -d --net prometheus --name prometheus -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 \
  -v $PWD/data:/prometheus \
  -v $PWD/conf/advanced_topics/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml  prom/prometheus:v2.0.0
```

_Exercise: write an alerting rule checking the validity of SSL certifcates._

### Pitfalls and gotchas

* Instrumentation
  * Limit the number of values per label (a `user_id` label is probably a bad idea).
  * Avoid missing time series.
  * Respect the naming conventions.
* Avoid dropping labels in alerts.
* Use the `for` clause in alerts and make it neither too short (< 1m) nor too long (> 1h).
* Don't scrape targets sparsely. The maximum recommended scrape interval is 2
  minutes because otheriwse Prometheus may mark time series as stale (the
  default look-back interval is 5 minutes).
* Always `rate()` before `sum()`.

### Federation

Federation allows a single Prometheus instance to gather metrics from multiple
Promethei. It is important to remember that only a subset of the original
metrics should be pulled.

### Remote storage

When you want to keep metrics around for longer than a couple of months or when
you want to consolidate metrics from different locations (â‰  federation), you
want to look at [remote
storage](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations)
options.
